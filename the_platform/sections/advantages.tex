\section{Resource Constrains}
\label{sec:res}

Meteor can be used to build resource constrain products.
In this type of application, the amount of processing and memory are often restricted.
Therefore, the use of parallel computing or decentralized tasks are common and necessary.
Meteor can be use to avoid heavy load computation in the limited hardware itself.
A server can be used to process all the required heavy workload while the client simply show in real time the results.

One way of providing an interface to a Meteor server side is by using the official server-client protocol, called \emph{Distributed Data Protocol} (DDP).
The DDP protocol is a simple specification on how other languages can communicate with a Meteor server.
