\label{sec:conc}

Meteor is a simple platform for building reactive applications on the Web 2.0 paradigma.
Its event drive method offers a real time experience for the users, besides a clear division between client and server sides tasks.
Thus, Meteor can be used in resource constrain products by providing a solution when splitting workload among the more powerful server and the lightweight client.
