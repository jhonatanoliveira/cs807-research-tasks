Sum-product networks (SPNs) are a layer-wise mathematical models for learning and inference with probabilistic graphical model. The main advantage of SPNs is that a learned model, under certain conditions, is guaranteed to have tractable inference in polynomial time, besides of inference being exact. Given a SPN, inference is done by propagating up on the network. In this paper, it is shown how the propagation can be done in parallel.
