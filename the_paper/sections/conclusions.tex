\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

SPNs are a new deep architecture to represent probability distributions.
They are better than other PGMs when learning from historical data.
The proposed model, though, lacks semantic when telling the relationship between variables, when compared to PGMs.
The work is carefully described and mathematically sound.
The lack of space in this conference paper made some parts of the report be brief, but not enough to affect the understanding.
The flow of ideas is well done and the presentation well conducted.
