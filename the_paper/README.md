# The Paper

The paper Sum-Product Networks: A New Deep Architecture introduces a new mathematical model for inference and learning, called sum-product networks. The new model is represented as directed acyclic graph with multiple layers, thus the classification as a deep architecture. The authors are clear and concise with their comments. The paper is well written and excels in presenting the considerable big content in the constrain of a limited space.
