\label{sec:conc}

Memcomputers are non-Turing paradigma of computers.
They use memelements as unit of processing and storage.
One application of memcomputers is shown by solving the shortest path problem.
Memcomputers are also known for solving NP-hard problems in polynomial time \citep{Traversa:2014vl}.
