\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

SPNs are layer-wise models used to represent JPDs in a compact and graphical way.
Inference in a SPN can be done by propagating up and down on the SPN DAG.
When propagating in the tree, operations in the same layer can be computed simultaneously, since they do not require input from within the same layer.
In this way, one can perform inference in SPN hopefully faster.
Future works will implement the proposed parallel method to verify improvements.
